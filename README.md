# Android helloPush Sample Application for Bluemix Mobile Services
---
This Android helloPush sample contains an Android project that you can use to learn more about the IBM Push Notification Service.

Use the following steps to configure the helloPush sample for Android:

1. [Download the helloPush sample](#download-the-hellopush-sample).
2. [Configure the mobile backend for your helloPush application](#configure-the-mobile-back-end-for-your-hellopush-application).
3. [Configure the front end in the helloPush example](#configure-the-front-end-in-the-hellopush-sample).
4. [Run the Android app](#run-the-android-app).

### Before you begin
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- A [Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) account.
- Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) credentials.  To obtain your GCM credentials, follow the instructions at  
https://www.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/t_push_provider_android.html

>**Note**: You'll need the project number (Sender ID) and API key to configure your credentials on the Bluemix Push Notification Dashboard.

### Download the helloPush sample
Clone the sample from GitHub using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-android-hellopush`

### Configure the mobile back end for your helloPush application
Before you can run the helloPush application, you must set up an app on Bluemix.  The following procedure shows you how to create a MobileFirst Services Starter application. The Starter application creates a Node.js runtime environment so that you can provide server-side functions, such as resource URIs and static files.  The CloudantÂ® NoSQL DB, Push Notifications, and Mobile Client Access services are added to the app.

Create a mobile backend in the Bluemix dashboard:

1. In the **Boilerplates** section Bluemix catalog, click **MobileFirst Services Starter**.
2. Enter a name and host for your mobile backend and click **Create**.
3. Once complete, scroll to the bottom of the page and select **View App Overview**.
4. From the **App Overview** page, you will see the **Mobile Options** displayed (**Route** and **App GUID**). Be sure to save these values, they will be needed later.

Configure Push Notification Service:

1. In the IBM Push Notifications Dashboard, go to the **Configuration** tab to configure your Push Notification Service.
2. Scroll down to the **Google Cloud Messaging** section. Enter your GCM project credentials, project number (Sender ID) and API key, and click **save**.

### Configure the front end in the helloPush sample
1. In Android Studio, open the helloPush Android project.
2. Run a Gradle sync (usually starts automatically) to import the required `core` and `push` SDKs. You can view the **build.gradle** file in the following directory:

	`helloPush\app\build.gradle`

3. Open the `MainActivity.java` class.
4. In the application `onCreate` method, add the corresponding `ApplicationRoute` and `ApplicationID` (AppGUID) that you saved earlier:


```Java
	@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

		...

        try {
            //initialize SDK with IBM Bluemix application ID and route
            //TODO: Please replace <APPLICATION_ROUTE> with a valid ApplicationRoute and <APPLICATION_ID> with a valid ApplicationId
            BMSClient.getInstance().initialize(this, "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>", "<APPLICATION_ID>", BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH);
        }
        catch (MalformedURLException mue) {
            ....
        }
```

> **Note**: If your Bluemix app is **not** hosted in US_SOUTH, be sure to update the region parameter appropriately: BMSClient.REGION_SYDNEY or BMSClient.REGION_UK.    

### Run the Android app
You can register and receive push notifications on an Android simulator or physical device.

When you run the application, it displays the **Register for Push** button. When you click this button, the application attempts to register the device and application to the Push Notification Service. The app displays an alert showing the registration status (successful or failed).

To send a push notification from the Bluemix dashboard follow [Sending basic push notifications](https://www.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/t_send_push_notifications.html)

When a push notification is received and the application is in the foreground, an alert is displayed showing the notification's content. The application uses the `ApplicationRoute` and `ApplicationID` specified in the `onCreate` method to connect to the IBM Push Notification Service on Bluemix. The registration status and content is displayed in the logcat console.

### Send data to push monitoring dashboard using analytics SDK

To use the Analytics SDK add the `dependency`

```
compile group: 'com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android',
name:'analytics',
version: '1.+',
ext: 'aar',
transitive: false
```

After completing the gradle build follow the below steps ,

1. Import the follwing ,

```
import com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.analytics.api.*;
import com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.logger.api.*;
```
2. Initialize the Analytics SDK,

```
Analytics.init(getApplication(), "appName", "apiKey", Analytics.DeviceEvent.LIFECYCLE);
Analytics.enable();
Logger.storeLogs(true);
Logger.setSDKDebugLoggingEnabled(true);
Analytics.setUserIdentity("some");
```
3. Send the Analtics data using the following methode call,

```
Analytics.send();
```
